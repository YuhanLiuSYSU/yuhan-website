            <p>As a physics student, you might start to code before you really "learn" to code. It is true that we can do a lot of amazing things by simply being familiar with some basic statements such as <code>if-else</code> and <code>for</code>. However, as your project grows larger and larger, you might come to a point that you want to stop and think about how to organize your code, such that it is easy to extend, easy to read (after you leave it for a year). Here I would like to share some of the practices that are helpful in my computation, some of which I summarized from my own experience, and some of which I learnt from reading other people's high quality codes.</p>
